<h1>Nyphs Menu Template</h1>

[Nyphs Menu Template](https://github.com/nyphrux/Nyphs-Menu-Template) is a mod menu template for Gorilla Tag with custom categories and the maximum amount of customization possible.

This template is meant for beginner developers as it is a very simplified version of [ii's Stupid Template](https://github.com/iiDk-the-actual/iis.Stupid.Template).

If you are better at coding, I advise you use [ii's Stupid Template](https://github.com/iiDk-the-actual/iis.Stupid.Template).

## Do I need permission to use this?
No, this template is free and public for anyone to use.

You are welcome to utilize it for your projects, modify it to suit your needs, and share it with others.

We believe in a collaborative and open community where resources are accessible to all.

However, I do request that credits are made where possible.
